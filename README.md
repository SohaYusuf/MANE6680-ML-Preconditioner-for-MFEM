# ML-Preconditioner-for-MFEM

The project aims to develop a machine learning-based preconditioner that can be implemented in the MFEM library to reduce the number of iterations required for an iterative solver.

MFEM is an open-source C++ library for finite element methods, which provides a flexible framework for building various applications involving partial differential equations (PDEs). One common challenge in solving PDEs is the high computational cost involved in each iteration of the solver. Therefore, iterative solvers are often used to reduce the overall computational cost by reducing the number of iterations required to achieve convergence.

However, iterative solvers require a good preconditioner to be effective, which can be a challenging task, especially for complex problems. Machine learning can potentially provide a solution to this challenge by developing a preconditioner that can learn the underlying structure of the problem and provide an effective approximation to the inverse of the coefficient matrix.

In this project, the goal is to develop a machine learning-based preconditioner that can be implemented in MFEM to improve the efficiency of iterative solvers. The preconditioner will be trained using a dataset of coefficient matrices and corresponding solutions obtained from the finite element method. The trained model will be evaluated on a set of test problems, and its performance will be compared with existing preconditioners. The project will involve the development of the machine learning algorithm, integration with the MFEM library, and testing and evaluation of the preconditioner.
